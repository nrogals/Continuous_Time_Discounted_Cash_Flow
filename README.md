Interest rates have been risen by the FED during 2022 and 2023 to combat inflation. 

Discounted Cash-Flows are important valuation tools used in investing. Most Discounted Cash-Flows are run in quarterly time, which assumes that all cash-flow earned throughout a quarter has been earned at the end of the period. Most cash flows are earned continuously or daily throughout the quater in real world. Hence developing a continuous-time discounted cash-flow can make better valuation decisions. I have developed a continuous-time discounted cash-flow that prices these cash-flows better than the traditional discounted cash-flow by 1.5%.

Repository provides calculations for better calculating the continuous-time discounted cash-flow.
